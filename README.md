# Towards Accessible Key-Value SSD Research With NVMeVirt

Welcome to the repository for the work described in the above paper. The KVSSD FTLs in this repository will
be updated and cleaned up regularly over the next while, so please check back often. This work is not a part of the
official NVMeVirt repository (https://github.com/snu-csl/NVMeVirt), but with some extra time and effort the KVSSD FTLs might added once the code is neat enough. The original NVMeVirt README with installation instructions is located at the bottom.

Included in this repository is the following:

- The original demand-based KVSSD FTL (DFTLKV) port to NVMeVirt (based on the good work at from https://github.com/dgist-datalab/PinK/)
- The updated version (DFTLKV+)
- The scripts required to replicate the tests in the paper
- A code walkthrough for the DFTLKV+
- A link to a VM image that you can use to replicate the tests easily (once we work out how to host one)

## Introduction

NVMeVirt is a versatile software-defined virtual NVMe device. It is implemented as a Linux kernel module providing the system with a virtual NVMe device of various kinds. Currently, NVMeVirt supports conventional SSDs, NVM SSDs, ZNS SSDs, etc. The device is emulated at the PCI layer, presenting a native NVMe device to the entire system. Thus, NVMeVirt has the capability not only to function as a standard storage device, but also to be utilized in advanced storage configurations, such as NVMe-oF target offloading, kernel bypassing, and PCI peer-to-peer communication.

Further details on the design and implementation of NVMeVirt can be found in the following [paper](https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast23/presentation/kim-sang-hoon).

## Installation

### Linux kernel requirement

The recommended Linux kernel version is v5.15.x and higher (tested on Linux vanilla kernel v5.15.37 and Ubuntu kernel v5.15.0-58-generic).

### Reserving physical memory

A part of the main memory should be reserved for the storage of the emulated NVMe device. To reserve a chunk of physical memory, add the following option to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX` in `/etc/default/grub` as follows:

```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="memmap=64G\\\$128G"
```

This example will reserve 64GiB of physical memory chunk (out of the total 192GiB physical memory) starting from the 128GiB memory offset. You may need to adjust those values depending on the available physical memory size and the desired storage capacity.

After changing the `/etc/default/grub` file, you are required to run the following commands to update `grub` and reboot your system.

```bash
$ sudo update-grub
$ sudo reboot
```

### Compiling `nvmevirt`

Please download the latest version of `nvmevirt` from Github:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/snu-csl/nvmevirt
```

`nvmevirt` is implemented as a Linux kernel module. Thus, the kernel headers should be installed in the `/lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)` directory to compile `nvmevirt`.

Currently, you need to select the target device type by manually editing the `Kbuild`. You may find the following lines in the `Kbuild`, which imply that NVMeVirt is currently configured for emulating NVM(Non-Volatile Memory) SSD (such as Intel Optane SSD). You may uncomment other one to change the target device type. Note that you can select one device type at a time.

```Makefile
# Select one of the targets to build
CONFIG_NVMEVIRT_NVM := y
#CONFIG_NVMEVIRT_SSD := y
#CONFIG_NVMEVIRT_ZNS := y
#CONFIG_NVMEVIRT_KV := y
```

You may find the detailed configuration parameters for conventional SSD and ZNS SSD from `ssd_config.h`.

Build the kernel module by running the `make` command in the `nvmevirt` source directory.
```bash
$ make
make -C /lib/modules/5.15.37/build M=/path/to/nvmev modules
make[1]: Entering directory '/path/to/linux-5.15.37'
  CC [M]  /path/to/nvmev/main.o
  CC [M]  /path/to/nvmev/pci.o
  CC [M]  /path/to/nvmev/admin.o
  CC [M]  /path/to/nvmev/io.o

  CC [M]  /path/to/nvmev/nvmev.mod.o
  LD [M]  /path/to/nvmev/nvmev.ko
  BTF [M] /path/to/nvmev/nvmev.ko
make[1]: Leaving directory '/path/to/linux-5.15.37'
$
```

### Using `nvmevirt`

`nvmevirt` is configured to emulate the NVM SSD by default. You can attach an emulated NVM SSD in your system by loading the `nvmevirt` kernel module as follows:

```bash
$ sudo insmod ./nvmev.ko \
  memmap_start=128G \       # e.g., 1M, 4G, 8T
  memmap_size=64G   \       # e.g., 1M, 4G, 8T
  cpus=7,8                  # List of CPU cores to process I/O requests (should have at least 2)
```

In the above example, `memmap_start` and `memmap_size` indicate the relative offset and the size of the reserved memory, respectively. Those values should match the configurations specified in the `/etc/default/grub` file shown earlier. In addition, the `cpus` option specifies the id of cores on which I/O dispatcher and I/O worker threads run. You have to specify at least two cores for this purpose: one for the I/O dispatcher thread, and one or more cores for the I/O worker thread(s).

When you are successfully load the `nvmevirt` module, you can see something like these from the system message.

```log
$ sudo dmesg
[  144.812917] nvme nvme0: pci function 0001:10:00.0
[  144.812975] NVMeVirt: Successfully created virtual PCI bus (node 1)
[  144.813911] NVMeVirt: nvmev_proc_io_0 started on cpu 7 (node 1)
[  144.813972] NVMeVirt: Successfully created Virtual NVMe device
[  144.814032] NVMeVirt: nvmev_dispatcher started on cpu 8 (node 1)
[  144.822075] nvme nvme0: 48/0/0 default/read/poll queues
```

If you encounter a kernel panic in `__pci_enable_msix()` or in `nvme_hwmon_init()` during `insmod`, it is because the current implementation of `nvmevirt` is not compatible with IOMMU. In this case, you can either turn off Intel VT-d or IOMMU in BIOS, or disable the interrupt remapping using the grub option as shown below:

```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="memmap=64G\\\$128G intremap=off"
```

Now the emulated `nvmevirt` device is ready to be used as shown below. The actual device number (`/dev/nvme0`) can vary depending on the number of real NVMe devices in your system.


```bash
$ ls -l /dev/nvme*
crw------- 1 root root 242, 0 Feb 22 14:13 /dev/nvme0
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 259, 5 Feb 22 14:13 /dev/nvme0n1
```
